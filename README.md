# drum&drumber

Full-stack drum machine app written for Week 15 Final CodeClan Project.  
The app is designed to play 16 digital sounds representing percussion instruments.  
To play each instrument, the user can either hit the pad button, which strikes one note, or select which beat to play by selecting a sequence button.  
Once all sequences are chosen for the desired instrument, the user can play all sequences by clicking the master play button.  
To save a sequence, click the sequence save button at the end, then select the master save button at the top.  
To clear the instrument sequence, select clear.  
Further development plans are to include a load option which will retrieve saved sequences from the database.  
Front-end written in JavaScript with React, back end in Java & Spring.
