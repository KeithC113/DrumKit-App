Full-stack drum machine app written for Week 15 Final CodeClan Project.  
The app is designed to play 16 different sounds, modeled on the Roland TR-808.  
To play each instrument, the user can either hit the pad button, which strikes one note, or select which beat to play by selecting a sequence button.  
Once all sequences are chosen for the desired instrument, the user can play all sequences by clicking the master play button.  
To save a sequence, click the sequence save button at the end, then select the master save button at the top.  
To clear the instrument sequence, select clear.
